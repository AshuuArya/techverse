        <h2>Why a Desktop PC?</h2>
        <div class="fakeimg float-in">

        <p>If you can live without the portability of a laptop or tablet, desktop PCs can provide you with more power as well as a different form of convenience. Compared to laptops, most pre-built PCs are more upgradable. Sure you can swap out hard drives, SSDs, and memory sticks on some laptops, but their CPUs and graphics are often soldered in, so your processing and graphics power will stay the same until your next purchase.</p>
        <p>Depending on the manufacturer, pre-built PCs can swap out most, if not all, components, including the graphics card, motherboard, and CPU. You do need to make sure to check back on your specifications though, whenever you’re changing out components.</p>
        <p>Another great thing about desktops? You don’t need to worry about charging a battery. Just plug it into a viable outlet and you’re good to go. Fortunately, since you’re going with a pre-built instead of do-it-yourself, you also don’t initially have to worry about compatibility issues or making sure your PSU can handle your components. Down the line when you do decide to upgrade, you can use Newegg’s power-supply calculator to ensure your system has the right amount of power.</p>

<h2>Who Should Buy a Desktop PC?</h2>
<p>Buying a desktop PC is a good idea if you want a household computer for the whole family to use. Desktops are more versatile than laptops since they have more ports for different types of monitors, keyboards, and other accessories. If you're a graphic designer or visual artist, you'll want a desktop with one or more large monitors.</p>
<p>When it comes to gaming, desktop PCs are more powerful than most laptops and even dedicated video game consoles. If you like VR games or online games with 3D graphics, you definitely need a desktop and a comfortable gaming chair.</p>
<h2>Main Factors to Consider Before Buying a Desktop PC</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Your Needs and Budget</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Processors</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Memory</strong></li>

        <h2>Operating System</h2>
        <p>An operating system connects physical hardware and software applications together. Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Linux are popular choices.</p>
        <p>Without an operating system, desktop PCs would just be immense paperweights with limited computing functions. A computer’s operating system is the overarching software that connects physical hardware and software applications together.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
        <div class="fakeimg float-in">
          <img src="https://diplo-media.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Microsoft-Logo-HD.jpg" width="350" alt="Windows icon png" />
        </div>
                <p>
          Made by Microsoft, Windows is one of the world’s most popular operating systems with the most current version being Windows 10. If you’re a hardcore gamer, Windows should be your operating system of choice due to the fact that most of the latest PC games are only available on Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the majority of their releases, Microsoft’s Windows 10 comes in a Pro and Home edition. The main difference between these versions is that Pro comes with enterprise business features such as group policy management, remote desktop and other IT-related business support. It’s best to use the latest version of the OS but, but as of writing, the Windows 7 operating system is the minimum requirement for games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice or video-editing applications like Adobe Premiere.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Mac</strong></p>
        <div class="fakeimg float-in">
          <img src="https://png2.cleanpng.com/sh/0f19363875655a7c2f740372d70f3b8c/L0KzQYm3U8MxN5VnfZH0aYP2gLBuTf1ia5D4Rd54Z3AwfbLqTcViapVqUKkBZULncYe7TscyPWo1SqQCMUW1QoSCVcI2PGo3UaQ3cH7q/kisspng-macos-logo-mac-5abde876e2da64.7159022715223952549292.png" alt="Mac OS Logo">
        </div>
             
        <p>
          The other major entry at the forefront of popular operating systems for desktop PCs is Apple’s macOS. As of writing the most current version of Apple’s flagship operating system is macOS Mojave. The Mac platform houses a fair amount of support for the latest games, but not enough to be useful to hardcore PC gamers. Whereas Windows can be considered an open environment when it comes to modding or developing components and software, Apple’s system is closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to abide by Apple’s rules, but the protection and privacy options you get with your Mac is top-notch. But this also means upgrades or self-repairs cannot be as easily executed on your Mac system. Nevertheless, millions of users love the features of macOS and Apple’s computers have become known as the machines of choice for artists and designers. Though prices may be high, the power and lifespan of the latest products generally match the initial investment.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Chrome OS</strong></p>
        <div class="fakeimg float-in">

                <p>
          A fairly new competitor, Google’s Chrome OS is an operating system based off Linux. Similar to their Android-based mobile operating systems, the latest Chrome OS desktop PCs utilize the Google Play Store for getting apps like Microsoft Office programs or streaming services like Netflix or YouTube.  Chrome OS desktop PCs can be highly cost-effective and useful for simple home entertainment, student work or small- to mid-sized businesses.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
        <div class="fakeimg float-in">
          <img src="https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/5/Linux-PNG-Image-File.png" alt="Linux Image Placeholder">
        </div>
                <p>
          Though Newegg only carries a few Linux-powered systems, this free, open-source operating system is highly efficient and effective for those interested in running server or large mainframe systems. Currently, one of the most-used distributions (distros) of Linux is called Ubuntu, but the beautiful thing about Linux is that users can choose from a number of publicly shared distributions and decide whichever one best fits their purposes.

    <h3>USB</h3>
    <p>Having been the standard since 1996, USB (universal serial bus) ports power the majority of connected devices that use wires.</p>
    <div class="fakeimg float-in">
      <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/usb-cable-socket-set_1284-22838.jpg?w=900&t=st=1707469530~exp=1707470130~hmac=d91032eb04c9a9cd26be0adff660e7be95e061966cbe82ba1da42b1351b3ff75" alt="USB Image">
    </div>
    
    <h3>Audio In/Out</h3>
    <p>If you’re using wired headphones or headsets with microphones, these 8mm jacks found on the front and/or back of your desktop PC are what you need to plug into.</p>

    <h2>Peripherals/Accessories to Consider</h2>
    <p>Monitors, keyboards, mice, audio devices, and video tech are important accessories to consider when buying a desktop PC.</p>
    
    <h3>Monitor</h3>
    <p>Monitors are the standard output video source for desktop PCs. Whether you’re gaming, working on graphic design, or need multiple monitors for running an efficient multi-tasking workload, you should note not all monitors are built the same. Generally speaking, if you’re looking to do some high-end gaming, you’ll need a monitor that has a high refresh rate (for example, 240Hz) and a low response time (1ms). Graphic designers will need a monitor that shoots for a 99% sRGB color-reproduction value to ensure their works look great across any other monitor.</p>
    <div class="fakeimg float-in">
      <img src="https://images.samsung.com/is/image/samsung/p6pim/in/ls27c900pawxxl/gallery/in-viewfinity-s9-27s90pc-ls27c900pawxxl-538034340?$684_547_PNG$" alt="Monitor Image">
    </div>
    
    <h3>Keyboard + Mouse</h3>
    <p>Similar to needing a monitor, you’ll probably find it difficult to use your desktop computer without a keyboard and mouse. Going wired is easy: just plug in your keyboard and mouse then you’re ready to compute. If you want to utilize a wireless keyboard and mouse, you’ll need to check whether it’s RF (radio frequency) or Bluetooth-enabled.</p>

  <h2>Choose the System that's Right for You</h2>
  <p>Consider your needs such as gaming, business, or student use, and browse through various categories like gaming desktops, business desktops, and student desktops.</p>
  <p>Technology is always advancing, so make sure to check back frequently for the latest updates on pre-built desktop PCs. As you can see, there are a variety of flavors when it comes to these systems, so if you need a little push in determining what kind of system you need, you can start by browsing three main categories: gaming desktops, business desktops, and student desktops.</p>
</section>


<h2>What to Do After You Buy a Desktop PC</h2>
<p>Once you've connected all the peripherals and booted up your PC for the first time, take steps to secure your PC from outside attacks before you connect to the internet. Connect your desktop directly to your modem for a more reliable signal. If your desktop came with a warranty, you may need to register it.</p>

<h2>More Tips</h2>
<p>Although you may be tempted to buy the cheapest desktop PC you can find, it's better to spend money on a device that's slightly more powerful than you need than one that's slightly less powerful than what you need. Just keep in mind that you'll also have to buy a lot of accessories unless you get an all-in-one desktop.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>When is the best time to buy a desktop PC?</strong><br>
If you're buying a computer for school, look for back-to-school sales in the fall. Otherwise, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are your best bets.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best mini desktop PC?</strong><br>
The best mini PCs include the Razer Tomahawk, Acer Chromebox CXI3, ZOTAC ZBOX CI622, MSI MEG Trident X, HP ProDesk 400 G5, and the Apple Mac Mini. If you want a kit to build your own, consider the Intel NUC 9 Extreme NUC9i9QNX or the Raspberry Pi 400.</p>
<p><strong>Who makes the best desktop PC?</strong><br>
It depends on what you're looking for, but the top PC brands include Dell, ASUS, HP, Acer, and Alienware.</p>
